As Bitcoin and blockchain technology continue to mature and develop, developers, investors and technology enthusiasts around the world are constantly exploring new opportunities in this field. Against this background, we are proud to announce that we will be participating in the Bitcoin Ecosystem Summit in Denmark on January 20, 2024. This summit will focus on the latest progress of the BRC20 standard and BTCLayer2 technology.

The BRC20 standard is a smart contract protocol based on the Bitcoin network, aiming to provide a more flexible and efficient transaction mechanism. BTCLayer2 technology is a second-layer solution built on the Bitcoin main chain. It opens a new path to Bitcoinâ€™s scalability by lowering transaction costs and increasing processing speeds.
