As we move through the inaugural phase of Initverse beta testing, our community's enthusiasm and engagement continues to exceed expectations. With over 17,225 registered users and the journey underway, progress is both tangible and exciting. Notably, our 11,031 loyal users continue to receive daily activity bonuses, demonstrating the active activity on our platform. This partnership not only demonstrates the robustness of Initverse, but also the commitment of our community.

During this phase we encountered some challenges, particularly with Twitter integration. We sincerely thank you all for your patience and support during these ups and downs. Your persistence is our motivation to move forward.

We are more excited than ever to invite each of you to share your innovative ideas and insights. Your feedback is invaluable and influences the development of Initverse. Please feel free to report any issues you encounter on our dedicated Telegram and Discord channels. Our team works hard to optimize the interface to further enhance your experience.

Looking ahead, the horizon is full of hope. We are launching a new version of the Initverse website, designed with user-friendly navigation and rich functionality to better serve our community. Additionally, important collaborations are underway. These include partnerships with industry leaders, top exchanges, and more, which will expand our ecosystem and enhance the features available to our users.

Stay tuned for our announcements - exciting updates and opportunities don't want to be missed. Keep participating every day, collect points, and invite friends with your unique referral link. The more points you accumulate, the greater the rewards of mainnet INI tokens. We are eagerly preparing to announce the exchange rate of testnet points to mainnet INI tokens and promise to provide generous rewards for your participation and loyalty.

With 1,049,853 visits to our platform, your engagement and enthusiasm make our collective vision for a decentralized future not only possible, but inevitable.

Thank you for being an integral part of our Initverse journey. Your active participation is shaping the decentralized tomorrow.
