Dear InitVerse Community Members,<br>
We are excited to announce the upcoming first round of the InitVerse Community Trading Competition! Here, we will provide detailed information about the process, rules, and rewards of the competition.

### Phase 1: Team Formation and Top 10 Token Voting
On July 8th, we will commence a week-long voting session on the InitVerse Telegram and Discord communities. Community members will vote to select the 10 most popular tokens. The voting process will be transparent, allowing members to view real-time progress.
Team Formation Rules: Participants must form teams of three.

#### Team Review Criteria:

Must be registered CANDY users.<br>
Teams need to register their CANDY user information with community administrators.<br>
Each team must create a team poster.

Team Formation Reward: Each team member will receive 500 testnet USDT, distributed within 72 hours after the voting ends.

Voting Period: July 8, 08:00 - July 14, 12:00 (UTC+4).<br>
Voting Method and Reward: Please join the InitVerse Telegram or Discord community. Register voting information through the link provided in the communities (including a 0x address for receiving points). After the voting ends, each participant will receive 100 INI points within 72 hours.

Top 10 Token Criteria: The top 10 tokens will be selected based on the number of votes, with each token needing at least 300 votes to qualify.

Phase 2: Announcement of Top 10 Tokens and Liquidity Injection
After the voting ends, the top 10 TOKENS, participant IDs, and team names will be announced on Twitter.

InitVerse will provide initial liquidity to the winning Tokens. Participants must inject 50% of the Tokens they created for the competition into this address: I44SxPJvbAtUEaRZ2mPovGzpULj9TbaKo5Hsoak9yeU6eLCDXQWWRMAVP

‚ö†Ô∏è Token Sale Restriction: Selling the remaining 50% of the tokens is prohibited. Violation of this rule will result in disqualification from the competition and forfeiture of any rewards obtained.

‚ö†Ô∏è Link Verification: All links must be verified by official members to avoid encountering fraudulent links during the event, which may lead to unnecessary losses.
Phase 3: Launch of the Official Trading Competition
The top 10 teams will enter the official trading competition, where each team can only trade the token they created. Other teams can still participate in trading for a chance to qualify as substitutes.

Competition Duration: Each trading competition will last 30 days, continuing until the mainnet launch (based on the announcement of the ‚ÄúEvent Official Start‚Äù tweet).
Weekly Qualification Check:

Trading Volume: The transaction volume of the participating token must not be less than 50,000 USDT. Token/Team below this volume will be disqualified and rewards forfeited. If there are vacancies, the 11th-ranked team from the voting can join the competition as a substitute, needing to achieve a minimum transaction amount of 20,000 USDT in the first week (only applicable for substitute tokens).

Liquidity Pool: The participating top 10 tokens/teams must maintain at least 45% of their created tokens during the official competition assessment. For example, Team A created INIC, was voted into the top 10, and participated in the competition. After injecting 50% of the token into the official address, it will be added to the liquidity pool. Weekly assessments will ensure that 50% of the liquidity is not below 45%; otherwise, the team will be disqualified and forfeit rewards.

Team Ranking Criteria: Teams will be judged based on their average monthly trading volume, with weekly assessments. Final rankings will be based on the monthly team transaction volume, which must not be less than 200,000 USDT. The top three teams will be selected monthly.
