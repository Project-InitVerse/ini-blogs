During the Filecoin Developer Summit in Iceland, Filecoin and IPFS retrieval was a topic of significant interest and excitement. The retrieval track, along with a number of related critical discussions, helped align the community on what’s needed for reliable Filecoin retrievals.There were two main focal points of conversation in the Filecoin Retrievals & Data Availability track. The first was the flywheel that’s developing for measuring and incentivizing retrievals - aiming to bring performant and reliable data retrieval to Filecoin. The second was a conversation about how to effectively structure data and transfer it efficiently across the network (transport protocols and data structuring).

## Concrete retrieval SLAs

The first goal was a clear understanding of what we need in retrieval. Multiple discussions described specific definitions of retrieval, which help to reduce uncertainty and allow for better retrieval measurement and optimization. In his talk Retrieval Requirements for Filecoin SPs, Jaun Benet defined retrieval types and shared his vision for how verified retrievals could be implemented on Filecoin.
