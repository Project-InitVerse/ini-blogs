Validator Testing Network is an important part of Initverse Network, which provides a platform for users to register and deploy validators. Here, we will detail how to apply to become a Validator by filling out a Google Form and provide a link to the relevant rules for your reference.
First, to become a validator of the Initverse testnet, you'll need to fill out a Google form to apply. The link to the application form is:

[InitVerse Validator Whitelist Application - Round I (google.com)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjS6Tmi1bE0b3wvnlBiicqDRrPMIDMIpYrc7ft7bsFyrHK0w/viewform)

When filling out the form, please be sure to provide accurate personal information and contact details so that we can get in touch with you in a timely manner.

Before applying to become a validator, be sure to read the rules and requirements carefully. You can view a detailed description of the rules by visiting

[Validator Registration and Deployment Instructions - InitVerse Network (gitbook.io)](https://inichain.gitbook.io/initverse-network/validador/validator-registration-and-deployment-instructions)

These rules include the registration conditions, deployment requirements, and reward mechanisms for validators, which are all important reference materials for users who want to become validators.

Once your application is approved, you will be eligible to become an Initverse testnet validator. Next, you need to follow the prescribed process to deploy and configure the nodes. When deploying a node, be sure to follow the specified requirements to ensure the stability and security of the node. Only validators who have passed the node deployment and configuration will be able to enjoy the corresponding rewards and benefits.

As a member of the Initverse Testnet, you will have the opportunity to participate in the construction and development of the Initverse Network ecosystem. Not only will you be rewarded, but you will also be able to contribute to the security and stability of the network. We hope that every validator will fulfill their role with due diligence and work together to promote the development of the Initverse Network.

In conclusion, Initverse testnet validator registration and deployment is a serious and important process. We expect every user who applies to become a validator to take it seriously, comply with the relevant regulations, and contribute to the development of the network. If you have any questions or need help becoming a validator, don't hesitate to contact us and we'll be happy to answer your questions and provide support. Looking forward to your joining.
