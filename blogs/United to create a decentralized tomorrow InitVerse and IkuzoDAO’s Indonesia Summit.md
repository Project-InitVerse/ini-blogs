# United to create a decentralized tomorrow InitVerse and IkuzoDAO's Indonesia Summit

On February 16, a major meetup was held in Indonesia, marking an important milestone for the Web3 community. InitVerse teamed up with IkuzoDAO to hold an offline exchange meeting to clarify InitVerse's mission and future roadmap. This event is more than just a conference; It is a beacon of collaboration, learning and shared vision.
This exchange is a melting pot of ideas, ambitions and insights. Attendees delved into the ethos of InitVerse and gained a clearer understanding of its fundamental mission: to harness the power of decentralized technology to build a more connected and powerful digital future.
This event highlights the importance of community in the fabric of Web3. This is a testament to InitVerse's commitment to not only building technology, but also nurturing the ecosystem around it. The gathering highlighted the importance of face-to-face interaction, even in a digital-first world, to foster stronger connections and more meaningful collaborations.
