We are delighted to announce that the InitVerse testnet is now officially open for public testing! This is an important milestone for the InitVerse community and the future development of decentralized platforms.

## What is the InitVerse Testnet?

The InitVerse testnet is a simulated network environment that emulates the real conditions of the InitVerse mainnet, allowing users to interact without the need for real assets. This environment is designed to provide an experience similar to the InitVerse mainnet and ensures that all features function smoothly before going live.

## Why Participate?

By participating in the testing, you will have the opportunity to preview the innovative features of InitVerse and help us improve and perfect the platform. Your feedback is crucial to us and will directly impact the stability and functionality of the InitVerse mainnet.

## Test Rewards

To thank you for your participation, we are offering token rewards to users who take part in testing the InitVerse. This is not only a recognition of your assistance but also an invitation for you to become an important part of our continuously evolving ecosystem.

## How to Participate?

Participation is easy:

1.Visit our official website: https://testnet.inichain.com, and start deploying tests. During the deployment testing process, you can first refer to InitVerse Docs: https://inichain.gitbook.io/initverse-network
2.Follow the guide in the InitVerse Docs to create your test account.
3.Begin exploring the various features and functionalities of InitVerse.

Important Note

Please be aware that the current InitVerse Docs and features are mainly for the testnet. Once the InitVerse mainnet goes live, necessary changes and improvements may be made.

We rely on your support and feedback to build a cutting-edge platform that truly meets user needs. Let's create the future of decentralization together!

Thank you for being an indispensable part of this journey.
