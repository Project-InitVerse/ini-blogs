# InitVerse’s breakthrough performance at Web3Europe 2023

At the Web3Europe event in Italy, InitVerse's demo sparked interest among the audience. Not only did it amplify its participation in the conference, but it also demonstrated a diversified and dynamically developing industry ecosystem through cooperation with multiple partners such as NEWS Meta, Genesis, LionDEX, Metabirds, KOI, AI World and Bibi.


InitVerse's central position in the WEB3 field and its influence in the industry have been fully demonstrated. Each partner brought their own unique innovations, and different projects demonstrated their own vision and direction through their own presentations. For example, a blockchain-based social media platform may be an exploration of a new technological dimension, while also summarizing the latest developments in public chains and DeFi. Through these collaborations and springboards, InitVerse promotes the development of a new, community-controlled economic system.


As a member of ROMIO, the global experimental director, he connected to InitVerse’s latest test network at this conference and shared these developments with the audience. This demonstrates InitVerse's dedication to continuing to provide transparent and open development progress. It also demonstrates the interest and participation of the global community.


InitVerse actively participates in various international activities and continues to expand its influence and popularity around the world. The partnerships and latest developments demonstrated at the Web3Europe event further consolidate its leading position in the WEB3 field. This also sets an example for other projects in the industry and encourages more innovators and partners to join the ecosystem.


InitVerse is ctively building communities and ecosystems around the world, and continues to promote the development of the WEB3 field through close cooperation with partners. The spirit of openness, tolerance and innovation displayed will undoubtedly have a profound impact on the entire industry.far influence.


In the future, we look forward to seeing more similar collaborations and innovations, as well as more outstanding projects and partners joining the open ecosystem advocated by InitVerse. I believe that globally, the WEB3 field will usher in more development opportunities and breakthroughs, and InitVerse will continue to play its important role in promoting all these development processes.
